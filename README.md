# Data Analytics Capstone Project: Human Resources

## Introduction:
In this project I utilized data sets collected from a company located in India. The data shows the in time and out time for each employee, survey data for both employees and managers, and general employee data from January to December 2015. 

## Objective:
Through analysis, next steps for the company in the upcoming 2 years would be determined to decrease attrition rates by 5%. To accomplish this the company would need to work on improving employee satisfaction, updating/providing additional training opportunities, and/or implementing changes to employee compensation. 

## Tools used:
To start, data was imported from 5 .csv files and cleaned up in Python and visuals were created in Python and Tableau to represent differences between employees who left in the previous year and those who are still employed at the company. Some steps included:
* Removed null values and replaced them with mean values in survey data
* Combined in time and out time data sets to help determine employee daily working hours
* Created new columns to find the count of employees who worked over and under the 8 hours
* Combined employee and manager survey data with general employee data to compare data when attrition was yes to when attrition was no for employees
* Data analysis using descriptive statistics, which included box plots, bar plots, and data tables
* Data analysis using inferential statistics by creating a linear regression model to predict employee attrition

## Results:
After completion of analysis it was determined that to decrease attrition rates the company would need to improve employee satisfaction by creating a cap on working hours for new employees, creating a mentor program to help guide new employees, and creating a cap on travel for employees. The company should also work to build up employees' knowledge by offering onsite training to gain additional skills needed for an internal promotion.
